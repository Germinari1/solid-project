# Solid App
This app explores concepts of design patterns and clean code by applying those in a management app that allows users to import, list, and export data, send emails, and manipulate data related to a fictional dog shelter (which is used as the background of the application). It is still in development, but this process should be efficiently done, given design principles employed when creating the application.
